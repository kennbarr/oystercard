#OYSTERCARD
##Makers Academy Project
The aim of this project is to create an oystercard which will allow users to pay for public transport. The users will be able to add a limited amount of money to the card, and the money will be reduced based on the calculated fare at the end of a journey when they touch out. The user can also see what zone they are in, as well as their previous trips. The user will be charged a penalty fare if they touch in but forget to touch out.
